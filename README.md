# Numerical Methods for Physics

This repository hosts the code written by Francesco marchisotti for the [NMP course](http://personalpages.to.infn.it/%7emignone/Numerical_Algorithms/) in the first year of the graduate course [Physics of Complex Systems](https://fisica-sc.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl).

**Note:** due to a refactoring of the library, the code in folders upto and including Chapter08 will need some refactoring to make it compile and run properly.
